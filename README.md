# guardian

Guardian is a simple experimental intrusion detection and prevention system,
intended to protect authenticated services such as ssh.

## The Goal

Guardian is an experiment in simple machine learning techniques and linux
system administration with python.

Guardian is intended to be a program that works straight out of the box. Once it
is running and you've chosen the services you want to protect, guardian will
use simple machine learning techniques to protect your services from attacks.

The ultimate goal is to have a program that you can install and never have to
configure or touch again.
